[assembly: AssemblyDescription("A WPF friendly port of the tango icon theme. Scalable SVG icons have been converted into XAML. Icons are embedded as the optimized BAML format, resulting in faster loading and a much smaller file size (about 1/2 of raw XAML, and 1/3 of raw SVG). The \"LazyConverter\" class does lazy intialization and provides conversions useful in various scenarios.")]
